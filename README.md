## Study

In one study, these five variables accounted for approximately 70% of the variation in match outcomes:

- The difference in team's wage bills
- The number of points the teams had earned in the previous season
- The number of goals scored by each team in their previous match
- The home advantage
- The number of days since the team's last match

## Other key factors to consider

-	Possession: Several studies have found that a team's share of possession can be a significant predictor of match outcomes. Teams that have a higher share of possession tend to have more opportunities to score goals and control the game.

-	Shots on target: The number of shots a team takes and the number of shots that are on target have also been found to be significant predictors of match outcomes. Teams that take more shots and have more shots on target are more likely to score goals and win matches.

-	Team quality: The quality of a team's players, as measured by factors such as their individual skill levels, experience, and past performance, can also be a significant predictor of match outcomes.

-	Home advantage: Studies have consistently found that playing at home can give a team an advantage, due to factors such as crowd support and familiarity with the playing conditions.

-	Momentum: A team's recent form and momentum can also play a significant role in match outcomes. Teams that are performing well and have a positive momentum going into a match may have a psychological advantage over their opponents.

-	Managerial tactics: The tactics and strategies employed by a team's manager can also influence match outcomes, particularly in terms of how a team sets up defensively or offensively.

## Metrics to measure player performance

-	Goals Scored: This is one of the most straightforward metrics used to evaluate a player's performance. It simply measures the number of goals a player has scored in a given time period.

-	Assists: An assist is when a player provides the final pass or touch before a goal is scored. This metric measures a player's ability to create goal-scoring opportunities for their teammates.

-	Shots on Goal: This metric measures the number of shots a player has taken that are on target. It can be an indicator of a player's shooting accuracy and ability to create scoring chances.

-	Pass Completion Percentage: This metric measures the percentage of a player's passes that are successfully completed. It can be an indicator of a player's ability to control the ball and distribute it effectively to their teammates.

-	Tackles and Interceptions: These metrics measure a player's defensive contributions, specifically their ability to win back possession of the ball from the opposing team.

-	Distance Covered: This metric measures the distance a player has covered during a match. It can be an indicator of a player's fitness and work rate.
